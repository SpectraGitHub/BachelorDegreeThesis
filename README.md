# Title 
**Empowering Data Analytics** - A Data Documentation Tool for Optimizing Data Driven Decisions

# Employer 
**Intility AS**

# Abstract
Intility is a leading provider of IT operations services in Norway and would like to gain a
competitive advantage by making more data-driven decisions. In their quest to use data more
actively, they requested a tool which provides easy insight into their data pipelines, ultimately
ending as reports used for making educated decisions.
Our group took on the challenge to create a web application for data documentation using
.NET and React. The application consists of a REST API for data retrieval and manipulation,
and a user-friendly web-based interface for managing and monitoring data pipelines.
The result is a comprehensive solution which gives an extensive overview of data processing
pipelines and provides functionality to manipulate parts of the pipelineâ€™s documentation. This
report illustrates the development process and its challenges, and how we overcame each one.
